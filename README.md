# ðŸ§ª Experiment 1 â€“ Basic Image Processing in MATLAB

This experiment focuses on fundamental operations in image processing using MATLAB. It includes converting a color image to grayscale, separating RGB color planes, and converting a grayscale image into a binary (black and white) format.

## ðŸ“„ Descriptions

### ðŸ”¹ 1a. RGB to Grayscale Conversion
- **Objective**: Convert a color image into a grayscale image.
- **Description**: Grayscale images are single-channel images where each pixel represents brightness intensity. This transformation reduces the complexity of color data while preserving structural content of the image. MATLAB computes grayscale values using a weighted sum of the RGB components.

### ðŸ”¹ 1b. RGB Color Plane Separation
- **Objective**: Extract individual Red, Green, and Blue components from an RGB image.
- **Description**: An RGB image is composed of three color channels. Separating these planes allows visualization of how each color contributes to the full image. Each plane is displayed as a grayscale image indicating intensity of that color component.

### ðŸ”¹ 1c. Grayscale to Black and White (Binary) Conversion
- **Objective**: Convert a grayscale image to a binary (black and white) image.
- **Description**: Binary images contain only two pixel valuesâ€”0 (black) and 1 (white). This conversion is commonly used in thresholding and object segmentation. Pixels above a specified threshold become white; those below become black. MATLAB supports both manual and automatic thresholding methods.
